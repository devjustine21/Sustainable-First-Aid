          <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
          <p class="ion-text-justify">A first aid kit is a standard item to have when preparing for any type of emergency. It is a kit that’s stocked with medical supplies such as antibiotic ointments, antiseptic wipes, aspirin, anti-itch creams, and thermometers. They also include items such as bandages, gauze, tweezers, and gloves. These kits can vary in size depending on how they’re intended to be used. People may carry a well-stocked kit in their vehicle for treatment of injuries that might occur when traveling. A person should also always keep a kit in their home, in a location that’s accessible to all adults in the house but out of the reach of children.</p>

Remove potential poison items. Store chemicals, medicines, cleaning supplies and other poisons high up in a locked cupboard or cabinet. Children can’t tell the difference between medicine and candy. Install child-safety latch on the doors of cupboards where you keep your poisonous items.</p>
